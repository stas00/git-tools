# update all .md files that have:
#
# <!--ts-->
# <!--te-->
#
# tags to inject (or update) the up-to-date TOC for that file.
#
# should be run every so often to be up-to-date (or when knowingly changing headers in .md files)
#
# notes:
# 1) The script relies on github api so without auth you only have 60 queries an hour.
#    To overcome the limit you can temporarily place your github access token in token.txt in the directory you run this script from
# 2) you will need curl installed

pwd=`pwd`
# - skip .git folder
# - only process .md files that have the <!--ts--> template in them.
# - must execute from the folder of the file to get the anchors right
